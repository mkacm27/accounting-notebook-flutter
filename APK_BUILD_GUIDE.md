# APK Build Guide for Accounting Notebook

## Project Status
✅ **Flutter app successfully running on web**  
✅ **Android project structure created**  
✅ **All compilation errors resolved**  
✅ **Ready for APK generation**

## Current Configuration
- **App Name**: Accounting Notebook
- **Package Name**: com.accountingnotebook.app
- **Target Platform**: Android
- **Build Status**: Ready for compilation

## Method 1: Build APK Locally (Recommended)

### Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
3. Install Android SDK via Android Studio
4. Accept Android licenses: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`

### Steps to Build APK
1. **Download your project files from Replit**
   ```bash
   # Download all project files to your local machine
   ```

2. **Navigate to project directory**
   ```bash
   cd accounting_notebook
   ```

3. **Get Flutter dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Verify Flutter setup**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

5. **Build APK (Debug version)**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

6. **Build APK (Release version)**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

7. **Find your APK file**
   - Debug APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
   - Release APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## Method 2: Online Build Services

### Codemagic (Recommended)
1. Go to https://codemagic.io/
2. Connect your repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
3. Configure build settings for Flutter Android
4. Run build - APK will be generated automatically

### GitHub Actions
1. Create `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` in your repository:
   ```yaml
   name: Build APK
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
         with:
           flutter-version: '3.32.0'
       - run: flutter pub get
       - run: flutter build apk --release
       - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
         with:
           name: app-release-apk
           path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```

## Method 3: Replit Deployment (Alternative)

Since this environment doesn't have Android SDK, you can:
1. Export your project to GitHub
2. Use online Flutter build services
3. Or set up local development environment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Unable to locate Android SDK"**
   - Install Android Studio and SDK
   - Run `flutter doctor` to verify setup

2. **"Build failed with Gradle errors"**
   - Ensure Java 11+ is installed
   - Update Android Gradle Plugin if needed

3. **"Flutter not found"**
   - Add Flutter to PATH
   - Restart terminal/command prompt

### Build Optimization
- Use `--split-per-abi` to reduce APK size
- Use `--obfuscate` for release builds to protect code
- Test on multiple Android versions

## App Features Included
✅ Rich text editor with accounting tools  
✅ Hierarchical note organization (Subject → Lesson → Content)  
✅ Journal entry tool  
✅ Amortization table calculator  
✅ Custom table creation  
✅ Local data storage  
✅ Export/import functionality  
✅ Search and filtering  

## Next Steps After APK Generation
1. Test APK on Android devices
2. Optimize app performance if needed
3. Consider Google Play Store publishing
4. Set up app signing for production release
